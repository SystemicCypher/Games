RPG game implementing D20 system

This is meant to be a single-player RP experience. 
The goal is for this to be as open-ended as possible while still having some form of structure.
Essentially a DM-less RP session.
Current progress: spells class has been introduced as well as characters. 
Next: finish character logic
After: finish spells logic
