# Really Pitiful Game
A simple rpg game based on DnD

This is meant to be a single-player RPG experience that does the fun stuff, combat. 
It's basically a fight and level up game, no other mechanics have been implemented, they will in the future....maybe.
This may just be a gamemode soon and the main game will be the more open-ended experience intended.

## Build Instructions
Go to the root folder (the one that has src in it) and then use SBT to compile and run this program, so use: sbt package, to package it into a jar or sbt run to run the code directly.

## To-Do

* Fix level-ups (every damage point is 1xp? - figure out levelling system)

* Implement spells and spellbooks

* Add random shops

* Add libraries

* Add inventory and equips

* Implement the master-student mechanic (Adventure only)

### ~~Tier 1 - complete!~~
~~Allow character creator to create characters~~ DONE!

~~Random enemies appear~~

~~Combat (need to punch orcs in the face)~~
