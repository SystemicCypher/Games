RPG game implementing D20 system
I'll probably finish this one up in Scala. I think I have a good idea where to go with it now.
This is meant to be a single-player RP experience. 
The goal is for this to be as open-ended as possible while still having some form of structure.
Essentially a DM-less RP session.
