# Really Pitiful Game
A simple rpg game based on Munchkin

This is meant to be a single-player RPG experience that does the fun stuff, combat. 
It's basically a fight and level up game, no other mechanics have been implemented, they will in the future....maybe.
This may just be a gamemode soon and the main game will be the more open-ended experience intended.

# To-Do
Finish class implementation (spells, attacks, and other such things for mages, fighters, rangers, etc)

Finish race implementation (Elves, dwarves, humans, and orcs aren't gonna implement themselves)

Allow character creator to create characters

Make NPCs

Let NPCs do things

Allow for parties to be formed

Random enemies appear

Combat (need to punch orcs in the face)

visual interface - command line
