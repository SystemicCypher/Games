# Really Pitiful Game
A simple rpg game based on DnD

This is meant to be a single-player RPG experience that does the fun stuff, combat. 
It's basically a fight and level up game, no other mechanics have been implemented, they will in the future....maybe.
This may just be a gamemode soon and the main game will be the more open-ended experience intended.

# To-Do

~~Allow character creator to create characters~~ DONE!

Random enemies appear

Combat (need to punch orcs in the face)

And that's it for iteration 1 of this game. Next iteration will flesh out the details more and adjust the numbers.
